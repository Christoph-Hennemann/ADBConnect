# ADBConnect

### What?
ADBConnect is a small Android application that simplifies developing for Android by establishing a ADB connection between the development device and the computer over WLAN. This is called 'ADB over WIFI'.
Depending on the phone state (Weather it is rooted or not) the application can turn on 'ADB over WIFI' automatically or with some adb commands entered by the developer. 
In either way the application provides help in form of textual instructions. Those can be hidden by a setting which enables the so called 'Simplified layout' which shows just a toogle for switching ADB modes.

### Why?
ADBConnect is not the first and might be not the last application developed with the purpose of simplifying the connection process. I mainly developed this application because I found the concept and the design behind it simple enough to use it as a kind of a sandbox application to test some technologies I was not very familiar with. I used ADBConnect to incorporate the clean architecture approach by Fernando Cejas found [here](https://github.com/android10/Android-CleanArchitecture).
Another reason to develop my own connection application is that I found no other app with the same functionality that implements Material Design.
